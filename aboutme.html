        <h5>About Me</h5>
        <p>
          Hi, my name is Lara and I have over 13 years industry experience. I’m a fully qualified level 3 Personal
          Trainer, Level 3 Pre and Postnatal Fitness specialist along with my various group fitness qualifications.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe in workouts that are fun, friendly but are going to get results. I want everyone to feel included
          and supported throughout their fitness journey whilst also being able to push people to hit their goals.

          <h3>Group Exercise</h3>
          <p>
            I started my group fitness career aged 18 where I qualified in Exercise to Music, giving me the oportunity
            to create my own choreography as well as teach my own fitness classes.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have been selected for the Les Mills presenter bootcamp twice, as well as been made a Les Mills Tribe
            Coach, and shadow on stage with the Programme director for SH'BAM in front or hundereds of instructors and
            participants at Alexandra Palace, London and in New Zealand. I have also represented Nuffield Health
            Leicester at the Pride event in Leicester with collegues and participants from the club.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love my job and love being able to create safe space for people to workout in. Creating workouts to
            challenge and motivate all fitness levels, improve people’s mental and physical health as well as watch
            people thrive in their fitness journeys.

        <h3>Pre & Postnatal Fitness</h3>
        <p>
          In 2019 I had my beautiful daughter Luna, I exercised throughout my pregnancy and have learnt a lot about my
          body during and after birth. I had a caesarean delivery so I am also familiar with recovery after this along
          with the changes in your body post partum.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having Luna spurred me on to finally train to be a pre and postnatal fitness specialist, so I can help mums
          and mums to be to exercise safely and effectively during this special time in their life. By boosting stamina
          and strength for labour and helping regain fitness levels, pelvic floor and core control post birth or just
          creating a safe space just for them, there are so many benefits to these sessions.
        </p>
        <p>

        <h3>Dancing</h3>
        <p>
          I started dancing age 3 and continued to take part in dance classes, with a gap where I switched and took
          gymnastics classes for a couple of years, until the age of 15. I achieved grades 1-3 in ballet and grades 1-5
          in tap as well as my completing gymnastics grades 5-1 too.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have always had a love of dance and movement with music and love trying out new dances as well as
          challenging myself by creating choreography for my various dance fitness workout classes.

        <h3>Tae Kwon Do</h3>
        <p>
          I started Tae Kwon Do age 13 and continued this until I was 22 where I could no longer attend classes due to
          my fitness classes taking over.
        </p>
        <p>
          During this time I achieved my 2nd degree Black Belt, became British champion in Patterns as well as placing
          in top 3 in other regional competions in patterns and team patterns. I have also umpired many large
          competitions around the United Kingdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is where my love of martial arts started and has helped me with my technique and allows me to use my
          broad knowledge to create my FIGHT FIERCE classes.
